    "# Hand-written Digit Recognition\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we'll give you a step-by-step walkthrough of building a hand-written digit classifier using the [MNIST](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MNIST_database) dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "MNIST is a widely used dataset for the hand-written digit classification task. It consists of 70,000 labeled grayscale images of hand-written digits, each 28x28 pixels in size. The dataset is split into 60,000 training images and 10,000 test images. There are 10 classes (one for each of the 10 digits). The task at hand is to train a model that can correctly classify the images into the digits they represent. The 60,000 training images are used to fit the model, and its performance in terms of classification accuracy is subsequently validated on the 10,000 test images.\n",
    "\n",
    "![png](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dmlc/web-data/master/mxnet/example/mnist.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Figure 1:** Sample images from the MNIST dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial uses MXNet's high-level *Gluon* interface to implement neural networks in an imperative fashion. It is based on [the corresponding tutorial written with the symbolic approach](https://mxnet.incubator.apache.org/tutorials/python/mnist.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Prerequisites\n",
    "\n",
    "To complete this tutorial, you need:\n",
    "\n",
    "- MXNet. See the instructions for your operating system in [Setup and Installation](https://mxnet.incubator.apache.org/install/index.html).\n",
    "- The Python [`requests`](http://docs.python-requests.org/en/master/) library.\n",
    "- (Optional) The [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/index.html) software for interactively running the provided `.ipynb` file.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "$ pip install requests jupyter\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Loading Data\n",
    "\n",
    "The following code downloads the MNIST dataset to the default location (`.mxnet/datasets/mnist/` in your home directory) and creates `Dataset` objects `train_data` and `val_data` for training and validation, respectively.\n",
    "These objects can later be used to get one image or a batch of images at a time, together with their corresponding labels.\n",
    "\n",
    "We also immediately apply the `transform_first()` method and supply a function that moves the channel axis of the images to the beginning (`(28, 28, 1) -> (1, 28, 28)`), casts them to `float32` and rescales them from `[0, 255]` to `[0, 1]`.\n",
    "The name `transform_first` reflects the fact that these datasets contain images and labels, and that the transform should only be applied to the first of each `(image, label)` pair."

    "### Defining a network: Multilayer Perceptron (MLP)\n",
    "\n",
    "MLPs consist of several fully connected layers.\n",
    "In a fully connected (short: FC) layer, each neuron is connected to every neuron in its preceding layer.\n",
    "From a linear algebra perspective, an FC layer applies an [affine transform](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affine_transformation) *Y = X W + b* to an input matrix *X* of size (*n x m*) and outputs a matrix *Y* of size (*n x k*).\n",
    "The number *k*, also referred to as *hidden size*, corresponds to the number of neurons in the FC layer.\n",
    "An FC layer has two learnable parameters: the (*m x k*) weight matrix *W* and the (*1 x k*) bias vector *b*.\n",
    "\n",
    "In an MLP, the outputs of FC layers are typically fed into an activation function that applies an elementwise nonlinearity.\n",
    "This step is crucial since it gives neural networks the ability to classify inputs that are not linearly separable.\n",
    "Common choices for activation functions are [sigmoid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sigmoid_function), [hyperbolic tangent (\"tanh\")](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperbolic_function#Definitions), and [rectified linear unit (ReLU)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rectifier_(neural_networks)).\n",
    "In this example, we'll use the ReLU activation function since it has several nice properties that make it a good default choice.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following code snippet declares three fully connected (or *dense*) layers with 128, 64 and 10 neurons each, where the last number of neurons matches the number of output classes in our dataset.\n",
    "Note that the last layer uses no activation function since the [softmax](https://mxnet.incubator.apache.org/api/python/ndarray/ndarray.html#mxnet.ndarray.softmax) activation will be implicitly applied by the loss function later on.\n",
    "To build the neural network, we use a [`HybridSequential`](https://mxnet.incubator.apache.org/api/python/gluon/gluon.html#mxnet.gluon.nn.HybridSequential) layer, which is a convenience class to build a linear stack of layers, often called a *feed-forward neural net*.\n",
    "\n",
    "The \"Hybrid\" part of name `HybridSequential` refers to the fact that such a layer can be used with both the Gluon API and the Symbol API.\n",
    "Using hybrid blocks over dynamic-only blocks (e.g. [`Sequential`](https://mxnet.incubator.apache.org/api/python/gluon/gluon.html#mxnet.gluon.nn.Sequential)) has several advantages apart from being compatible with a wider range of existing code: for instance, the computation graph of the network can be visualized with `mxnet.viz.plot_network()` and inspected for errors.\n",
    "Unless a network requires non-static runtime elements like loops, conditionals or random layer selection in its forward pass, it is generally a good idea to err on the side of hybrid blocks.\n",
    "For details on the differences, see the documentation on [`Block`](https://mxnet.incubator.apache.org/api/python/gluon/gluon.html#mxnet.gluon.Block) and [`HybridBlock`](https://mxnet.incubator.apache.org/api/python/gluon/gluon.html#mxnet.gluon.HybridBlock)."

    "#### Initializing parameters and optimizer\n",

    "(Recall that we set the batch size to 100 in the [\"Loading Data\"](#loading-data) part.)\n",
    "\n",

    "Training the network requires a way to tell how well the network currently fits the training data.\n",
    "Following common practice in optimization, this quality of fit is expressed through a *loss value* (also referred to as badness-of-fit or data discrepancy), which the algorithm then tries to minimize by adjusting the weights of the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ideally, in a classification task, we would like to use the prediction inaccuracy, i.e., the fraction of incorrectly classified samples, to guide the training to a lower value.\n",
    "Unfortunately, inaccuracy is a poor choice for training since it contains almost no information that can be used to update the network parameters (its gradient is zero almost everywhere).\n",
    "As a better behaved proxy for inaccuracy, the [softmax cross-entropy loss](https://mxnet.incubator.apache.org/api/python/gluon/loss.html#mxnet.gluon.loss.SoftmaxCrossEntropyLoss) is a popular choice.\n",
    "It has the essential property of being minimal for the correct prediction, but at the same time, it is everywhere differentiable with nonzero gradient.\n",
    "The [accuracy](https://mxnet.incubator.apache.org/api/python/metric/metric.html#mxnet.metric.Accuracy) metric is still useful for monitoring the training progress, since it is more intuitively interpretable than a loss value.\n",
    "\n",

    "In this case, it is rather obvious that our MLP network is either too simple or has not been trained long enough to perform really great on this dataset, as can be seen from the fact that some of the mislabeled examples are rather \"easy\" and should not be a challenge for our neural net.\n",

    "### Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)\n",
    "\n",
    "A fundamental issue with the MLP network is that it requires the inputs to be flattened (in the non-batch axes) before they can be processed by the dense layers.\n",
    "This means in particular that the spatial structure of an image is largely discarded, and that the values describing it are just treated as a long vector.\n",
    "The network then has to figure out the neighborhood relations of pixels from scratch by adjusting its weights accordingly, which seems very wasteful.\n",
    "\n",
    "A CNN aims to address this problem by using a more structured weight representation.\n",
    "Instead of connecting all inputs to all outputs, the characteristic [convolution layer](https://mxnet.incubator.apache.org/api/python/gluon/nn.html#mxnet.gluon.nn.Conv2D) only considers a small neighborhood of a pixel to compute the value of the corresponding output pixel.\n",
    "In particular, the spatial structure of the image is preserved, i.e., one can speak of input and output pixels in the first place.\n",
    "Only the size of the image may change through convolutions.\n",
    "[This article](http://deeplearning.net/software/theano/tutorial/conv_arithmetic.html) gives a good and intuitive explanation of convolutions in the context of deep learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "The size of the neighborhood that a convolution layer considers for each pixel is usually referred to as *filter size* or *kernel size*.\n",
    "The array of weights -- which does not depend on the output pixel location, only on the position within such a neighborhood -- is called *filter* or *kernel*.\n",
    "Typical filter sizes range from *3 x 3* to *13 x 13*, which implies that a convolution layer has *far* fewer parameters than a dense layer."

    "Filters can be thought of as little feature detectors: in early layers, they learn to detect small local structures like edges, whereas later layers become sensitive to more and more global structures.\n",
    "Since images often contain a rich set of such features, it is customary to have each convolution layer employ and learn many different filters in parallel, so as to detect many different image features on their respective scales.\n",
    "This stacking of filters, which directly translates to a stacking of output images, is referred to as output *channels* of the convolution layer.\n",
    "Likewise, the input can already have multiple channels.\n",
    "In the above example, the convolution layer takes an input image with 16 channels and maps it to an image with 32 channels by convolving each of the input channels with a different set of 32 filters and then summing over the 16 input channels.\n",
    "Therefore, the total number of filter parameters in the convolution layer is `channels * in_channels * prod(kernel_size)`, which amounts to 4608 in the above example.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another characteristic feature of CNNs is the usage of *pooling*, i.e., summarizing patches to a single number, to shrink the size of an image as it travels through the layers.\n",
    "This step lowers the computational burden of training the network, but the main motivation for pooling is the assumption that it makes the network less sensitive to small translations, rotations or deformations of the image.\n",
    "Popular pooling strategies are max-pooling and average-pooling, and they are usually performed after convolution.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following code defines a CNN architecture called *LeNet*.\n",
